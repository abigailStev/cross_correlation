		cross_correlation
		
Computing the cross-correlation function of a reference band with channels of interest.

CONTENTS:

ccf.py -- Computes the cross-correlation function of two light curves to do phase-resolved 
spectroscopy. Able to read light curves from data with the program 'populate_lightcurve'.

multi_ccf.py -- Computes the cross-correlation function of a band of interest with a 
reference band over multiple data files.

plot_ccf.py -- Plots the cross-correlation function.

plot_multi.py -- Plots multiple cross-correlation functions on one plot.

run_ccf.sh -- Bash script to run ccf.py.

run_multi_ccf.sh -- Bash script to run multi_ccf.py
